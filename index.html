### 🚀 Deployment Tip
When you upload these files to your GitHub repository (e.g., `Dhanamgranites`), make sure the `style.css` file is physically present in the main directory. If the CSS still doesn't load after these changes, check your browser console (F12) to see if the file path for `style.css` is returning a 404 error.

**Would you like me to provide the complete, corrected code for the entire file to ensure no tags are missing?**
